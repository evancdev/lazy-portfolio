  bulletPoints:
  - Build a full Tetris engine with a 10×20 board, 7-tetromino system, collision physics, line clearing, scoring, and real-time OpenCV rendering to serve as a reliable RL environment.
  - Develop a heuristic search model using weighted board features (height, holes, bumpiness, lines cleared) to benchmark RL performance.
  - Train + refine a DQN model using Keras with epsilon-greedy policy + 32-unit ReLU layers, enabling 2,000+ self-play episodes via batched replay and checkpointing to optimize score and survivability.

    - OCaml
  bulletPoints:
  - Design + implement an immutable player module with OCaml record types and 10+ pure functions to provide an interface to manage player attributes across all game modules.
  - Develop a procedural encounter system that generates 3-node paths from encounter types, ensuring non-deterministic progression leading to a final boss encounter.
  - Engineer a shop state with level-based inventory and transactions using pattern matching and custom exceptions to buy + remove cards and validate purchases.
  - Test over 200+ edge cases across 9 modules - combining black + glass box strategies to ensure correctness of state management + transitions.

  techStack:
    - Unity
    - C#
  bulletPoints:
    - Led player systems engineering within a 15-member development team, managing a 4-person sub-team and coordinating cross-module integration.
    - Designed a universal knockback system used across the player and 6+ enemy types, computing normalized impact vectors and applying weighted impulse forces for consistent hit reactions.
    - Implemented core 2D movement mechanics including dashing, jump gravity curves, acceleration tuning, buffered inputs, and responsive player control behavior.
    - Engineered responsive 2D player mechanics combining precise movement control (dashing, jump gravity curves, acceleration tuning, buffered inputs) with robust combat logic featuring hitbox/hurtbox detection, invincibility frames, and validated attacks.
    - Developed a timing-based melee combat system integrating an animation state machine with animation locks, early-cancel windows, and scriptable weapons supporting diverse attack types (slash, down strike, air slash, up slash).
    - Tuned combat and movement values through iterative playtesting, adjusting attack speed, knockback strength, gravity behavior, and movement responsiveness.
