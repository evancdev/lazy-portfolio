  bulletPoints:
    - Engineer a reinforcement learning system to autonomously play Tetris by designing and implementing a DQN agent with experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and customizable neural network architectures using Keras and TensorFlow.
    - Develop a fully-functional Tetris game environment with collision detection, board state management, and real-time rendering using OpenCV and NumPy, serving as the training platform for the AI agent.
    - Implement heuristic search that calculates board properties including aggregate height, bumpiness, and hole detection as baseline comparison metrics.

    - OCaml
  bulletPoints:
    - Develop a roguelike dungeon-crawler card game in OCaml, leveraging functional programming paradigms such as immutable state, pattern matching, and algebraic data types to build a robust and maintainable codebase.
    - Design core gameplay systems, including player progression, procedural encounter generation, and a dynamic shop with tier-based card offerings and economic validation to enhance strategic depth and replayability. Ensured type-safe state transitions across battle, shop, camp, and chance encounters through modular architecture, exception handling, and rigorous functional design patterns.

  techStack:
    - Unity
    - C#
  bulletPoints:
    - Led player systems engineering within a 15-member development team, managing a 4-person sub-team and coordinating cross-module integration.
    - Designed a universal knockback system used across the player and 6+ enemy types, computing normalized impact vectors and applying weighted impulse forces for consistent hit reactions.
    - Implemented core 2D movement mechanics including dashing, jump gravity curves, acceleration tuning, buffered inputs, and responsive player control behavior.
    - Engineered responsive 2D player mechanics combining precise movement control (dashing, jump gravity curves, acceleration tuning, buffered inputs) with robust combat logic featuring hitbox/hurtbox detection, invincibility frames, and validated attacks.
    - Developed a timing-based melee combat system integrating an animation state machine with animation locks, early-cancel windows, and scriptable weapons supporting diverse attack types (slash, down strike, air slash, up slash).
    - Tuned combat and movement values through iterative playtesting, adjusting attack speed, knockback strength, gravity behavior, and movement responsiveness.
