  bulletPoints:
    - Engineer a reinforcement learning system to autonomously play Tetris by designing and implementing a DQN agent with experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and customizable neural network architectures using Keras and TensorFlow.
    - Develop a fully-functional Tetris game environment with collision detection, board state management, and real-time rendering using OpenCV and NumPy, serving as the training platform for the AI agent.
    - Implement heuristic search that calculates board properties including aggregate height, bumpiness, and hole detection as baseline comparison metrics.

  bulletPoints:
    - Develop a roguelike dungeon-crawler card game in OCaml, leveraging functional programming paradigms such as immutable state, pattern matching, and algebraic data types to build a robust and maintainable codebase.
    - Design core gameplay systems, including player progression, procedural encounter generation, and a dynamic shop with tier-based card offerings and economic validation to enhance strategic depth and replayability. Ensured type-safe state transitions across battle, shop, camp, and chance encounters through modular architecture, exception handling, and rigorous functional design patterns.
